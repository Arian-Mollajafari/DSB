# DSB modulation
Realtime DSB communication system simulation

We have three matlab functions: modulator, channel, and demodulator.

After running DSB.m we can hear a white noise added to the audio file "PinkPanther.wav"

Then, we can run Real_time_DSB.m. Now we can talk to microphone and hear our voice simultaneously
for T seconds.

There is also an additional examination:
Plotting the output SNR in terms of channel noise level and bandwidth for a cosine input
